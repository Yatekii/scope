- SNR

- THD
    - fundamental carrier
    - num harmonics
        - sqare integrate
- rms

- Fix the Hertz scale
- Add an amplitude display
- Make markers relative to the dataframe and not the screen
- Display trigger location
- Make zoom dependant on active trace
    - Make x-zoom for time and fft traces uncoupled
    - same for y-zoom, but all traces can have uncoupled y-zoom
- Drag display to move active trace
    - fft simply gets moved
    - time traces will have the trigger location moved
